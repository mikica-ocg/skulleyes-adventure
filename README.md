# Skulleyes Adventure
SkullEyes powered proof of concept skirmish game.

## Building the Project
First, you'll need the same set of asset and addons that I use. List coming soon. For now, you can figure it out by looking at gitignore and blender_conversion_drivers dir.

After adding required assets, run "python convert_external_assets.py" in the project's root dir.
